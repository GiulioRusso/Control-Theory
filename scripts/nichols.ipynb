    "# Nichols Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Nichols Plot** is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system in the complex plane, showing the variation of magnitude and phase with frequency. It is useful for analyzing the stability and performance of control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability Margins:**\n",
    "- **Gain Margin (GM):** It represents the factor by which the gain of the system can be increased before the system becomes unstable. A higher gain margin indicates greater stability.\n",
    "- **Phase Margin (PM):** It is the amount by which the phase of the system can be increased before the system becomes unstable. A higher phase margin indicates greater stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Nichols Plot:\n",
    "- **Gain Margin:** The gain margin is the distance in decibels between the magnitude plot and the 0 dB line (unity gain) at the phase crossover frequency.\n",
    "- **Phase Margin:** The phase margin is the distance in degrees between the phase plot and the -180° line (180 degrees out of phase) at the magnitude crossover frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance:**\n",
    "- A system is considered stable if it has positive gain and phase margins.\n",
    "- Stability margins provide insights into the robustness of the system. Larger margins indicate a more robust and stable system.\n",
    "- The Nichols Plot helps engineers visualize the trade-off between gain and phase, aiding in the design and tuning of control systems.\n",
